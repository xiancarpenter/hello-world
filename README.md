# hello-world
This repository is for practice.
My name is Christian and my nickname is Kitty. I love the sciences and the arts, equally, and love to learn new things. I enjoy hiking, running, and geocaching when I am outside, and playing video games, reading and playing on the interwebs when I am inside. I am the most extroverted introvert you will ever meet.
